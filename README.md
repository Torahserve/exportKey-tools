# exportKey-tools
Currently it is a pain in the A** to export bee key in to metamask as they are not compatible. This programe will export the private key so that people can import it in metamask or other wallets.

Usage: main.exe <sourceDirContainingBeeKeys> <password>
 
Assumption: currently it assumes that you use the same password for all the keys in the dir :-)

Disclaimer:

This will display the private key so please do it in a safe place.
There is absolutely no gurantee that your key will work or your fund security.
** Please use at your own risk **
